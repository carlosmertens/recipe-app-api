# Recipe Application API

## Description

This project is to create an application to storage and manage a collection of cooking recipes.

This project follows a real life production path using TDD (Test Driven Development) and Travis-CI to keep a quality and save of bugs source code.

Tools used Python, Djanfo and Django Rest Frame in the back-end and PostgreSQL to manage the database.

## Technologies

Application created with the following technology:
1. Virtualization Tool
- Docker (Docker-compose)
2. Programming language and Framework Tool
- Python 3.7 (PEP-8, Linting)
- Django 0.0 (Object Relational Mapper (ORM), Admin)
- Django Rest Framework (Authentication, Viewsets, Serializers, Browsable API) 
3. Test Driven Development Tool
- Travis-CI (Unit test and linting tool)
4. Version Control Tool
- Git
- GitHub
5. Database Tool
- PostgreSQL

## Test Driven Development
API calls to endpoints:
1. Setup - Create sample database objects
2. Execution - Call the code to test the sample database
3. Assertions - Confrim expected output
