Tools used Python, Djanfo and Django Rest Frame in the back-end and PostgreSQL to manage the database.

## Technologies

Application created with the following technology:
1. Virtualization Tool
- Docker (Docker-compose)
2. Programming language and Framework Tool
- Python 3.7 (PEP-8, Linting)
- Django 0.0 (Object Relational Mapper (ORM), Admin)
- Django Rest Framework (Authentication, Viewsets, Serializers, Browsable API)
3. Test Driven Development Tool
- Travis-CI (Unit test and linting tool)
4. Version Control Tool
- Git
- GitHub
5. Database Tool
- PostgreSQL

## Test Driven Development
API calls to endpoints:
1. Setup - Create sample database objects
2. Execution - Call the code to test the sample database
3. Assertions - Confirm expected output
